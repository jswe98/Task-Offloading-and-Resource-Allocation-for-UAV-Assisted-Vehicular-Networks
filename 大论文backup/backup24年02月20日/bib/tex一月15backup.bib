%abstract = {Many mobile and pervasive applications avail cloud services to reduce overheads in on-device computation. The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases. We briefly explain the relevant challenges and future directions in emerging domains, such as the Internet of drones and Digital twins. We also discuss future research directions in task/service migration, offloading, resource management, distributed computing, reliability, and Quality of Service, all related to mobility in MEC.}}

    for low-loss guiding of terahertz radiation. First, we present a
    fiber of several wavelengths in diameter containing an array of sub-wavelength
    holes separated by sub-wavelength material veins. Second, we detail
    a large diameter hollow core photonic bandgap Bragg fiber made of
    solid film layers suspended in air by a network of circular bridges.
    Numerical simulations of radiation, absorption and bending losses
    are presented; strategies for the experimental realization of both
    fibers are suggested. Emphasis is put on the optimization of the
    fiber geometries to increase the fraction of power guided in the
    air inside of the fiber, thereby alleviating the effects of material
    absorption and interaction with the environment. Total fiber loss
    of less than 10 dB/m, bending radii as tight as 3 cm, and fiber bandwidth
    of ~ 1 THz is predicted for the porous fibers with sub-wavelength
    holes. Performance of this fiber type is also compared to that of
    the equivalent sub-wavelength rod-in-the-air fiber with a conclusion
    that suggested porous fibers outperform considerably the rod-in-the-air
    fiber designs. For the porous Bragg fibers total loss of less than
    5 dB/m, bendingradii as tight as 12 cm, and fiber bandwidth of ~
    0.1 THz are predicted. oupling to the surface states of a multilayer
    reflector facilitated by the material bridges is determined as primary
    mechanism responsible for thereduction of the bandwidth of a porous
    Bragg fiber. In all the simulations,polymer fiber material is assumed
    to be Teflon with bulk absorption loss of130 dB/m.},

    To increase the imaging speed, we proposed a fast CW-THz imaging
    system in which a galvanometer is introduced. The galvanometer makes
    the beams reflected in different angles by vibrating at a certain
    frequency which can significantly decrease the image acquisition
    time compared to traditional CW-THz imaging system. Furthermore,
    the system is compact due to source and detector of small size. Examples
    of measurements of concealed weapons are presented and discussed.

  abstract = {The analogy between electromagnetic wave propagation in multidimensionally
    periodic structures and electron wave propagation in real crystals
    has proven to be a very fruitful one. Initial efforts were motivated
    by the prospect of a photonic band gap, a frequency band in three-dimensional
    dielectric structures in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden,
    irrespective of propagation direction in space. Today many new ideas
    and applications are being pursued in two and three dimensions, and
    in metallic, dielectric and acoustic structures, etc. The author
    reviews the early motivations for this work, which were derived from
    the need for a photonic band gap in quantum optics. This led to a
    series of experimental and theoretical searches for the elusive photonic
    band-gap structures, those three-dimensionally periodic dielectric
    structures which are to photon waves what semiconductor crystals
    are to electron waves. Then he describes how the photonic semiconductor
    can be 'doped', producing tiny electromagnetic cavities. Finally
    he summarizes some of the anticipated implications of photonic band
    structure for quantum electronics and the prospects for the creation
    of photonic crystals in the optical domain.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical study of the polarization properties of the
    broadband supercontinuum (SC) generated in birefringent photonic
    crystal fibers (PCFs). The simulations are based on generalized coupled
    nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with quantum noise taken into
    account. The simulations illustrate the complicated polarization
    behavior in the SC spectra and show that the pulse-to-pulse polarization
    state of SC spectra fluctuates because of vector modulation instability.
    We investigate the polarization stability and uniformity of SC spectra
    under several simulation conditions and discuss generation of the
    SC in birefringent PCFs for applications with various polarization
    requirements.},

    method. Numerical results demonstrate that by appropriate design
    such fibers can function in a single-mode/single-polarization operation,
    exhibit high- or low- birefringence behavior, or switch between an
    on-state and an off-state (no guided modes supported). All of the
    above can be controlled by the application of an external electric
    field, the specific liquid crystal anchoring conditions and the fiber
