%\subsection{System Model}
In this paper,We consider A IoV edge computing network, consisting of cloud computing layer, MEC layer,
as shown in Fig. 1. For MEC layer,which has moderate computation capacity and deploys close to networks, can be used to assist the vehicles. Cloud computing layer,can be used to process the large-scale, delay-insensitive data that MEC layer can not process¡£
¡¶Reinforcement Learning¡·¡£numerous vehicle-to-RSU (V2I) cells underlay a macrocell. in which each RSU
is equipped with a MEC server to provide computation offloading services to the vehicles£¬To avoid inter-cell interference, the time division multiple access (TDMA) communication technology is adopted. Time resource is divided into multi-frames, and each frame is divided into several time slots. Different VUEs access its time slots when they communicate with the RSU, and signal transmission in different time slots will produce no interference [10].¡¶su03¡·¡£We denote the set of users and MEC servers in the mobile system as U = {1, 2,...,U} and S = {1, 2,...,S}, respectively. ¡¶joint¡·Some notations are given in Table I

\subsection{Communication Model}
Different from the traditional cellular communication,Due to the fast mobility of vehicles, their CSIs are hard to be estimated precisely. In particular, RSU can only achieve the accurate knowledge of large-scale fading $ L^2 $ of vehicular to RSU links while the small-scale fading $h$ is greatly influenced by the fast channel variations caused by the Doppler effect. We assume that such CSIs is obtained through channel estimation ¡¶eeh¡·, Therefore, we model the small-scale fading channel estimation of $h$ by using the first-order Gauss¨CMarkov process [27] in each TTI as follows
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E1}
h=\xi{\widetilde{h}}+\sqrt{1-\xi^2}\zeta,
\end{eqnarray}
we assume that the estimated channel gain ${\widetilde{h}} $ denotes the estimate of $ h $ and ${\widetilde{h}}^2 $ is exponentially distributed with unit mean [33]. Furthermore, $\xi\epsilon\left(0,1\right)$ represents the correlation coefficient over v ¡ú m link, and $\zeta$ stands for the channel gain and follows a complex Gaussian distribution $\zeta_{v,m}\sim{CN\left(0,\delta^2\right)}$.and independent and uncorrelated of ${\widetilde{h}}$. The coefficient $(0 <\zeta< 1) $ quantifies the channel correlation between the two consecutive time slots and we assume that time correlation coefficient $\zeta$ is same for all VUEs. According to the Jakes statistical model for the fading channel [28], $\zeta$ is given as
$\zeta$=$J_{0}\left(2 \pi f_{\max } T_{s}\right)$(4)

where $ J_0$ is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind. $f_{max} =\bar{\nu}f_c/c$ is the maximum Doppler frequency, where $\bar{\nu}$ indicates the vehicle speed, $f_c $indicates the carrier frequency, and $f_{max}$=$\bar{\nu}f_c/c$ ,
$T_s$ is a period feedback latency. Generally,both transmitter vehicles and RSU can know the accurate$ \zeta$.

Based on the aforementioned discussion, the mobile V2I channel power gain of the effective links and interference links in kth time slot can be expressed as a shared expression:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
G_{i,j}^k={\hat{g}}_{i,j}^k+{\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k,
\end{eqnarray}
Where $ {\hat{g}}_{i,j}^k=L_{i,j}^2{\widetilde{h}}_{i,j}^2\xi_{i,j}^2$ , $ {\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k=L_{i,j}^2\left(1-\xi_{i,j}^2\right)\ $$\zeta_{i,j}^2$ , and $ {L_{i,j}^k}^2$ denotes the kth time slot large-scale fading effects including shadow-fading and path loss from ith transmitter to jth receiver on the road section¡£Moreover, $ {\hat{g}}_{i,j}^k $ is an observed value. ${\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k$ denotes an exponential random variable with parameter $E\left(\frac{1}{{L_{i,j}^k}^2\sqrt{1-{\zeta_{i,j}^k}^2}}\right)$.

To improve the spectrum utilization and realize multi-vehicles joint communication, V2I communications reuse the same uplink channel. In this case, the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) from vehicle $i$ to RSU can be formulated as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
\gamma_i^v=\frac{p_ig_{i,j}}{{\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{M}{p_jg_{j,i}}+\sigma}^2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ p_j $ denotes the transmit power of the jth vehicles,where $\sigma^2 $ is the background noise.Therefore, the deterministic equivalent transmission rate of VUEs calculated by Shannon¡¯s theorem is,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
{R_i\left(P\right)=log}_2{\left(1+\frac{p_ig_{i,j}}{{\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{M}{p_jg_{j,i}}+\sigma}^2}\right)}
\end{eqnarray}
Hence, the transmission time of vehicle u when sending its task input $ d_u $ in the uplink can be calculated as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
t_{i,up}=\frac{d_{i,up}}{R_i\left(P\right)}
\end{eqnarray}
Where $ d_{i,up} $ is the amount of input data including system settings, program codes, and input parameters £¬which is necessary to transfer the program execution. And W is the bandwidth of the reused channel. Therefore, the upload time of each V2I link can be formulated as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
t_{i,up}=\frac{d_{i,up}}{W{log}_2{\left(1+\frac{p_ig_{i,j}}{{\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{M}{p_jg_{j,i}}+\sigma}^2}\right)}}
\end{eqnarray}

Communication delay is another significant index that affects the performance of wireless networks. The packets to V2I receivers must be in the queue before they transmit at the speed of $ R_i$. It is assumed that the process of a packet arriving at the ith V2I receiver is a Poisson process with parameter$ k_i$, and the length of the data packet obeys the exponential distribution of parameter $ \tau_i$. Under the M/M/1 model [34], the relationship between the expected delay and transmission rate of the ith V2I links can be expressed as .
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
D_i=\frac{1}{{\tau_iR}_i-k_i}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{vehicle Computing Model}
we consider that each vehicle $ v\in V $ has one different computation task at a time. denoted as $ c_v $ [cycles] specifies the workload, i.e., the amount of computation to accomplish the task£¬ that is atomic and cannot be divided into subtasks. The values of $ c_v $ can be obtained through carefully profiling of the task execution [7],[32]. Each task should be offloaded to the MEC server and then transmission to the cloud server. By offloading the computation task to the MEC server, the vehicles would get more computing resources,however, it would consume additional time for sending the task input in the uplink.
The MEC server at each RSU is able to provide computation offloading service to a vehicle at a time slot .The computing resources are quantified by the fixed rate $\bar{f} $, expressed in terms of number of CPU cycles/s. the vehicle n uploads the input data of task to the nearest RSU£¬the RSU process the small-scale, delay-sensitive data first, then the RSU forward the remaining data to the remote cloud server. the cloud is able to provide computation offloading service to multiple RSU concurrently. The computing resources made available by cloud to be shared among the associating users are quantified by the computational rate $f_i$, it is still expressed in terms of number of CPU cycles/s ,Thus, the latency for computing offloading can be written as.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
t_{i,exe}=\frac{c_{i,e}}{\bar{f}+f_i}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Problem  Definition}
Given the computing resource allocation $ f_i$, the total delay experienced by vehicle u when offloading its task is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
 t_i=\frac{c_{i,e}}{\bar{f}+f_i}+T_c
\end{eqnarray}
 The transmission latency between RSU and cloud server is defined as $ T_c$, usually it is set to a fix value, so the relative improvement in task completion time is characterized by,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
U_{i,exe}=\frac{t_{max}-t_{i,exe}}{t_{max}}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ t_{max}$ is the maximum tolerable threshold of the task completion time£¬If a task can be completed ahead of deadline $ t_{max}$, the vehicle can get a higher utility, otherwise, it will produce the corresponding loss.Therefore, we define the offloading utility of vehicle u as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
\frac{U_{i,exe}}{t_{i,up}}
\end{eqnarray}
denote offloading time cost utilities at a unit.
For a given uplink power allocation P, and computing resource allocation F, we define the system utility as the weighted-sum of all the users¡¯ offloading utilities,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
U=max\sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{U_{i,exe}}{t_{i,up}}
\end{eqnarray}
This utility means getting a more enormous execution time utility with a minor upload time cost ,We now formulate the Joint Resource Allocation and Task Offloading problem as a system utility maximization problem, i.e. The robust optimization problem is formulated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
\textbf{O}:&max\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{U_{i,exe}}{t_{i,up}}\\
s.t.&\left\{
\begin{array}{llll}
&Pr\left\{\gamma_i\le\gamma_{th}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_1,\\
&Pr\left\{\frac{1}{\tau_iR_i-k_i}+\frac{c_{i,e}}{\bar{f}+f_i}\le D_{max}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_2,\\
&\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_i\le f_{total},\\
&0\leq P_a\leq P_{a,max}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
where U denotes the network utility,The constraints in the formulation above can be explained as follows:
Constraints (8c) is used to guarantee the QoS requirements of VUEs,however,due to Large amount of computation caused by time varying network topologies£¬the real-time SINR is hard to obtain in vehicular communication scenario, and it can be replaced with the long-term SINR since the CSI feedback time interval is very small.$ \gamma_i $ denotes the average SINR of the ith V2I link when a small CSI feedback time interval is used£¬In order to ensure that the task is successfully offloaded to the RSU,its SINR should be guaranteed to be no less than the SINR threshold.¡¶su02¡·dmin is the SINR threshold for successful detecting the V2I communication.$p_r\left\{\cdot\right\}$ defines the probability of the input£¬In this case, we introduce the outage probability constraint (8c) to guarantee the reliability of vehicular links.¡¶Ð¡Ë§¡·Di,max is the upper delay bound of the ith D2D pair in the process of data transmission.$\varepsilon_1$,$ \varepsilon_2 $ are the outage probability thresholds of SINR and delay constraint respectively, where $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2\in\left(0,1\right)$.constraints (12g) state that each MEC server must allocate a positive computing resource to each user associated with it and that the total computing resources allocated to all the associated users must not excess the server¡¯s computing capacity.C6 states that the number of applications served by a particular edge cloud should be within its capacity.C2 denote the total latency of communication and computing should be guaranteed to be no less than the time threshold.pi,max is the maximum transmit power of the transmit vehicle in vehicle communication network,and the transmit power is greater than zero.

\section{Problem  fromulation}
In this section, we proposed a BCD-based algorithm to solve the problem (7). The BCD method enables the complex original problem to be decomposed into a series of simpler subproblems [13]. Motivated by this fact, all variables are divided into two blocks and optimized alternatively.
By fixing F, the problem (7) can be transformed into the following problem.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
\textbf{O}:&max\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{U_{i,exe}}{t_{i,up}}\\
s.t.&\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
&Pr\left\{\gamma_i\le\gamma_{th}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_1,\\
&Pr\left\{\frac{1}{\tau_iR_i-k_i}+\frac{c_{i,e}}{\bar{f}+f_i}\le D_{max}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_2,\\
&0\leq P_a\leq P_{a,max}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Successive Convex Approximation of the Objective Function}
Since the original problem is a non-convex and NP-hard because of the logarithmic function in the objective function, here, the method of successive convex approximation is adopted to relax the original problem and make objective function solvable. We can use the lower bound to approach the original function as follows.

\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
\alpha ln{\left(z\right)}+\beta\le ln{\left(1+z\right)}\\&
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
&\alpha=\frac{z_0}{1+z_0}\\
&\beta=ln{\left(1+z_0\right)}-\frac{z_0}{1+z_0}ln{\left(z_0\right)}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

Each term of (5) can be represented by $\alpha_kln\left(\gamma_k\left(e^{\widetilde{\mathbf{p}}}\right)\right)+\beta_k $ through successive convex approximation, where $\alpha_k $ and $ \beta_k $ can be chosen as $\alpha_k=\gamma_i/\left(1+\gamma_i\right) $, $\beta_k=ln{\left(1+\gamma_i\right)}-\alpha_kln{\left(\gamma_i\right)}$, $\alpha_k$=1, $\beta_k$ =0, and each term of objective function can be written as follows :

\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left.U_{i,exe}\left[{A_kln{\left(\gamma\left(p\right)\right)}+B}_k\right.\right],
\end{eqnarray}

it is still hard to directly calculation because of fractional from of SINR, we use variable substitution, i.e. ${\hat{p}}_i=ln{p_i} $,$ p_i=e^{{\hat{p}}_i}$, then ${\hat{p}}_i\le l n{p_{max}},\ \ \forall\ \ 1\le i\le M$
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
EE=max\frac{1}{ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}}\ast\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left.U_{i,exe}\ast\left[{A_kln{\left(\gamma\left(e^{\widetilde{P}}\right)\right)}+B}_k\right.\right],
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Extension to Error Channel Gain With Unbounded Support}
It is obvious that the constraint (6) includes uncertainties and the objective function is a non-convex problem in (5). The objective function and constraints are difficult to deal with when determining the optimal solutions. it is necessary to design an algorithm with lower complexity to solve the problem. In this paper, For the uncertain channel gain. Considering the fast fading, Two common forms are adopted to describe the uncertainty mentioned above, i.e. the statistical constraints and deterministic constraints. to pursue a simple form of (d),a matrix form is introduced,the general form the channel gain is described as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
Pr\left\{\left(G_m\right)^Te^{\widetilde{p}}+\sigma^2\le0\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_1,
\end{eqnarray}
Where$ mT$,Furthermore, the Bernstein method is adopted to approximate the probability constraint with channel uncertainty
Theorem 1: The outage probability of all cochannel V2I links$ Pr\left\{\gamma_i\le\gamma_{th}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_1$
is reformulated as the separable constraints (26)
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
\sigma^2+\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\chi_{i,j}e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}+\sqrt{2ln\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_1}\right)}\left(\sum_{m=1}^{M}\left(\sigma_{i,j}\beta_{i,j}p_i\right)^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}\le0,
\end{eqnarray}
Where $\chi_{i,j}=\mu_{i,j}^+\alpha_{i,j}+\beta_{i,j}+gi,j$, these parameters (i. e., $\sigma_{i,j}$ and $\alpha_{i,j}$ )are deduced to be positive in Appendix A.Suppose that the truncated distributions of$ G_{i,j} $have bounded supports$ \left[{\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k+\alpha_{i,j},{\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k+\beta_{i,j}\right] $£¬$ {\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k $is an estimate of$ G_{i,j} $,Introduce constants $\alpha_{i,j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_{i,j}-a_{i,j}\right) $,$ \beta_{i,j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_{i,j}+a_{i,j}\right) $ to normalize the supports to$ \left[-1,1\right]$ as follows,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
\xi_{i,j}=\frac{G_{i,j}-{\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k-\beta_{i,j}}{\alpha_{i,j}}\in\left[-1,1\right],
\end{eqnarray}
In the last term of (15), the variables$ p $are coupled nonlinearly. Hence, directly finding an acceptably good solution to (9) by the Bernstein method is time consuming when the K increases and the number of vehicles is large. Therefore, it is necessary to Introduced a l2-norm approximate problem for any$ x\in R^k $£¬Hence, The last term in (12) containing l2-norm of the vector is further approximated by$ x2¡Üx1$ , Based on these, the constraint in (12) is further formulated as$ \sigma^2+\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\chi_{i,j}e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}+\sqrt{2ln\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_1}\right)}\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\left|\sigma_{i,j}\beta_{i,j}\right|e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}\le0 $with lower complexity and higher reliability.
The constraint (9a) can be handled by an Integral transformation method,According to constraint (9a)), where$D_{max}=D_1+D_2 $,$D_1=\frac{1}{\tau_iR_i-k_i} $,$ D_2=\frac{c_{i,e}}{f_i} $,$a=\frac{1}{{L_{i,j}^k}^2\sqrt{1-{\zeta_{i,j}^k}^2}}$ we can get the feasible power region of the communication delay probability as follows
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E2}
\left(I_{th}+\sigma^2\right)\left(2^\frac{1+kD}{D\tau}-1\right)+\ {\hat{g}}_2e^{\widetilde{P}}\le0,
\end{eqnarray}

The proof of the feasible region can be found in Appendix B
\begin{proof}
The probability constraint of C2 can be transformed to the deterministic one according to the following inference
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Pr\left\{\frac{1}{\tau_iR_i-k_i}+\frac{c_{i,e}}{f_i}\le D_{max}\right\}\\
=Pr\left\{R_i\le\frac{1}{R_i\left(D_{max}-D_2\right)}+\frac{k_i}{\tau_i}\right\}\\
\le1-Pr\left\{p_i{\widetilde{g}}_{i,j}^k\le\left(I_{th}+\sigma^2\right)2^\frac{1+k_i\left(D_{max}-D_2\right)}{\tau_i\left(D_{max}-D_2\right)}-p_i{\hat{g}}_{i,j}^k\right\}\\
=1-\exp{\left({a\hat{g}}_{i,j}^k-a\frac{\left(I_{th}+\sigma^2\right)2^\frac{1+k_i\left(D_{max}-D_2\right)}{\tau_i\left(D_{max}-D_2\right)}}{p_i}\right)}\le a\varepsilon_2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}
In summary, we can obtain a deterministic optimization problem of robust power allocation by transforming the objective function, outage probability constraints, delay constraints. It is expressed as,


\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
\textbf{O}:&max{EE\left(\widetilde{P}\right)}=max\frac{1}{\ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}}\ast\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left.U_{i,exe}\ast\left[{A_kln{\left(\gamma\left(e^{\widetilde{P}}\right)\right)}+B}_k\right.\right]\\
s.t.&\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
&\sigma^2+\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\chi_{i,j}e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}+\sqrt{2ln\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_1}\right)}\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\left|\sigma_{i,j}\beta_{i,j}\right|e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}\le0,\\
&\left(I_{th}+\sigma^2\right)\left(2^\frac{1+kD}{D\tau}-1\right)+\ {\hat{g}}_2e^{\widetilde{P}}\le0,\\
&-\infty\le{\widetilde{p}}_i\le l n{p_{i,max}}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Optimal Power Control Algorithm}

To pursue an iterative algorithm for solving the problem,Lagrange dual decomposition technique [39] is used to maximize the lower bound of the original objective under given coefficients Xi and Yi. It¡¯s noted that these two coefficients should be updated to guarantee amonotonic increase in the lower bound performance.
Hence, the Lagrangian function of (17) under fixed coefficients Xi and Yi can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E3}
L\left(\widetilde{\mathbf{p}},\lambda,\mu\right)=\frac{1}{\ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}}\sum_{i=1}^{M}{U_{i,exe}\left[A_kln{\left({\bar{\gamma}}_k\left(e^{\widetilde{\mathbf{p}}}\right)\right)}+B_k\right]}\\
\notag-\lambda_k\left[\sigma^2+\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\chi_{i,j}e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}+\sqrt{2ln\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_1}\right)}\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\left|\sigma_{i,j}\beta_{i,j}\right|e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}\le0\right]\\
-\mu_k\left[\left(I_{th}+\sigma^2\right)\left(2^\frac{1+kD}{D\tau}-1\right)+\ {\hat{g}}_2e^{\widetilde{P}}\le0\right],\notag
\end{eqnarray}
Based on (33), the iteration for the power allocation , can be formulated as,
\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
{\widetilde{p}}^{\left(t+1\right)}=\left[ln{\frac{A_jU_{i,exe}}{\ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}}}-ln{\left(\frac{U_{i,exe}}{\ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}}\sum_{j=1,j\neq k}^{K}{A_j\frac{{\bar{\gamma}}_j\left(e^{\widetilde{p}}\right){\bar{G}}_{k,j}}{e^{{\widetilde{p}}_j}{\bar{G}}_{j,j}}}\\
+\lambda_k\left(\sigma^2+\sqrt{2ln{\left(\frac{1}{\theta}\right)}}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left|\sigma_{i,k}\beta_{i,k}\right|\right)+\mu_k\hat{g}\right)}\right]_{-\infty}^{ln{p_{max}}}
%\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The Lagrangian multiplier ¦Ë, ¦Í, are updated through the sub-gradient method, which are formulated as,
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i,j}^{\left(t+1\right)}=\left[\lambda_{i,j}^{\left(t\right)}+\sigma^2+\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\chi_{i,j}e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}+\sqrt{2ln\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_1}\right)}\sum_{i=1}^{M}{\left|\sigma_{i,j}\beta_{i,j}\right|e^{{\widetilde{p}}_i}}\right]^+
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{i,j}^{\left(t+1\right)}=\left[\mu_{i,j}^{\left(t\right)}+\left(I_{th}+\sigma^2\right)\left(2^\frac{1+kD}{D\tau}-1\right)+\ {\hat{g}}_2e^{\widetilde{P}}\right]^+
\end{equation}
\subsection{computing resource allocation}
After obtaining P, the formulated problem with respect F reformulated by:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
\textbf{O}:&max\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{U_{i,exe}}{t_{i,up}}\\
s.t.&\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
&Pr\left\{\gamma_i\le\gamma_{th}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_1,\\
&Pr\left\{\frac{1}{\tau_iR_i-k_i}+\frac{c_{i,e}}{\bar{f}+f_i}\le D_{max}\right\}\geq1-\varepsilon_2,\\
&0\leq P_a\leq P_{a,max}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

Notice that the constraints in (25b) and (25c) are convex, by calculating the second-order derivatives of ¦«(X,F) w.r.t.$ f_i $ the Lagrangian function is constructed to seek the optimal powers. Hence, (25) is a convex optimization problem and can be solved using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The Lagrangian function of (33) is formulated as,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L\left(\mathbf{F},\xi,\varphi\right)=\frac{1}{ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{R_i\left(P\right)\left[1-\left(\frac{c_{i,e}}{t_{max}\left(\bar{f}+f_i\right)}+\frac{T_c}{t_{max}}\right)\right]}\\
-\xi_k\left(\frac{1}{\tau_iR_i-\lambda_i}+\frac{c_{i,e}}{\bar{f}+f_i}\ \le D_{max}\right)-\varphi_k\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_i-f_{total}\right]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Based on (33), the iteration for the computing resource allocation , can be formulated as,
In order to prove the concavity of P5, the following research is taken.The first-order derivative of U0 c with respect to $f_i$ is,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u\left(\mathbf{F},\xi,\varphi\right)}{\partial f_i}=\frac{c_{i,e}}{ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}t_{max}\left(\bar{f}+f_i\right)^2}=\frac{\mathrm{\Omega}_i}{\left(\bar{f}+f_i\right)^2}
\end{equation}
in which, for simplicity $$\mathrm{\Omega}_i=\frac{c_{i,e}}{\ln{2}\ast d_{i,up}\ast t_{max}}$$
The second-order derivative of is obtained further as,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2U}{\partial f_i^2}=-\frac{2\cdot\mathrm{\Omega}_i}{\left(\bar{f}+f_i\right)^3}\le0
\end{equation}
it is obvious that The second-order derivative of U0 c with respect to ci is always less than 0. Therefore, U0 c is a concave function about ci, Hence, (25) is a convex optimization problem and can be solved using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u\left(\mathbf{F},\xi,\varphi\right)}{\partial f_i}=\frac{\mathrm{\Omega}_iR_i\left(P\right)}{\left(\bar{f}+f_i\right)^2}-\xi_k\frac{c_{i,e}}{\left(\bar{f}+f_i\right)^2}-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\varphi_k=0
\end{equation}
Let$$
\frac{\partial u\left(\mathbf{F},\xi,\varphi\right)}{\partial f_i}=0
$$the optimal computing resource allocation is:obtained by
\begin{equation}
{f_i}^\ast=\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{\Omega}_yR_i\left(P\right)-{c_{i,e}\xi}_k}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\varphi_k}}-\bar{f}
\end{equation}
The iterative expression is as follows,

\section{SIMULATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}

In this section, numerical simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed Algorithms 1.A mec-based vehicular network system which includes five clusters under a certain time slot is selected as our fundamental simulation scenario. The major system parameters are listed in Table III. It is noted that the carrier frequency f and the bandwidth W are set as 2 GHz and 10 MHz respectively in the numerical simulations,We assume that both the vehicles and rsus use a single antenna for uplink transmission and reception, respectively.Unless stated otherwise, the parameter value of $ \gamma_{th} $ is set to 10?6, the outage probability threshold $\varepsilon_1=\varepsilon_2=0.1$.

Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) show that the power of each vehicle transmitter and the corresponding computing resource which cloud allocation to RSU in Algorithm2, respectively. It can be seen that the computing resources allocated in the cloud peak at the fifth iteration and begin to decline because of the limitation of total computing resources $ f_{total} $ from the cloud. The corresponding power resource allocation also changes due to computing resources allocation under Joint Robust Power Control and Task Offloading Scheduling.

This phenomenon is reasonable due to the definition of ¦ÇEE in (24). $R_i$ increases logarithmically as the power vector $ \mathbf{p} $ increases, the upload time $ t_{i,up}$, as the denominator of ¦ÇEE, will decrease with the increase of power vector $ \mathbf{p} $ and as the executive utility of the numerator part, $t_{i,exe} $ decreases inversely proportional with the increase of computing power $ \mathbf{f} $,causing the numerator to increase with the increase of $\mathbf{f}$.


In the Mec-Enabled vehicular cloud system. It is unrealistic not to take into account the mobility of the vehicle, We then investigated the impact of vehicle mobility on system performance, Assume the variation of the vehicles¡¯ speed is negligible within the reference time interval,
In order to further illustrate the influence of speed-induced Doppler shift on system performance, the comparison experiment between the benchmark value and the increasing speed measurement under the condition of constant vehicle speed is simulated in the system.
Since the relative speed in the V-RSU link is zero, And the speed of all vehicles is the same in the same network there is no Doppler effect. Then the vehicle speed on the road is set to 20 m/s, 30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s and 60 m/s, respectively£¬It can be seen from Fig. 11 that with the increase of vehicle speed, the utility value of the v2e network decreases, This is because the higher speed will cause a greater Doppler frequency shift in the network, increase channel uncertainty, The solid blue line result also proves that methods that tend to obtain a better utility when the vehicle speed Is low.

where $P_a$ is the radar transmit power of vehicle A, $\mathbf{x}_a$ is the transmitted signal by the radar of vehicle A.
The received signal at vehicle A is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E3}
\mathbf{y}_a[i]\!=\!\sqrt{P_a}\alpha h_{ab}^2\mathbf{x}_a[i]+\sqrt{P_b}h_{ba}\mathbf{x}_b[i]\\
+\sqrt{P_J}h_{ja}\mathbf{x}_j[i]+\mathbf{n}_a[i],\notag
\end{eqnarray}
Based on (33), the iteration for the power allocation , can be formulated as,

where $\alpha$ denotes the energy efficiency of reflection, $\mathbf{x}_b[i]$ is the transmitted signal by the tag on vehicle A.

For the link from vehicle A to vehicle B, we have the two hypotheses as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E4}
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathcal{H}_0:\mathbf{y}_b[i]=\sqrt{P_J}h_{jb}\mathbf{x}_j[i]+\mathbf{n}_b[i] \\
\mathcal{H}_1:\mathbf{y}_b[i] = \sqrt{P_a}h_{ab}\mathbf{x}_a[i]+\sqrt{P_J}h_{jb}\mathbf{x}_j[i]+\mathbf{n}_b[i],
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

The signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio received at vehicle B is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E5}
SINR_b=\frac{P_a|h_{ab}|^2}{P_J|h_{jb}|^2+\sigma_b^2}
\end{eqnarray}


The signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio received at vehicle A is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
SINR_a=\frac{(P_b+P_a\alpha|h_{ab}|^2)|h_{ba}|^2}{P_J|h_{ja}|^2+\sigma_a^2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $h_{ba}=h_{ab}$.
%Considering the actual communication channel gains are uncertain and different to obtain, the target outage threshold is introduced to guarantee the normal communication of FUs and the energy harvesting of ERs.
%Therefore, the optimization problem in the non-colluding scenario aiming to maximize the secrecy rate is formulated as\footnote{In the two scenarios the QoS constraint of MU will be added after the transformation of objective function to avoid the situation that the SINR of MU can not meet the requirement of communication when the number of FBS is large. In this case, the transmit of MU can be constrained and the complexity of the problem can be simplified.}

%\subsection {Problem Formulation}
The optimization problems (P1) and (P2)  aim to maximize the utility functions that are the difference of payoff (maximization of SINR) and the cost functions
(minimization of power). $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, and $\mu_3$ are the cost prices of the offered powers ($P_a$, $P_b$, and $P_J$), respectively. For the problem (P1), it consider the link from vehicle A to B. The probability constraint in (P1) is an outage probability constraint, which ensure a reliable radar links. The constraint $\xi_{ab} \geq 1-\varepsilon_{ab}$ aims to transmit radar signal covertly, $\xi_{ab}$ is the error detection probability.
For problem (P2), it consider the echo link from the tag on vehicle B to A . The probability constraint in (P2) is an outage probability constraint, which ensure a reliable communication links. The constraint $\xi_{ba}\geq 1-\varepsilon_{ba}$ aims to transmit the mixed signal (radar plus communication signal) covertly, $\xi_{ba}$ is the error detection probability. $\varepsilon_a$, $\varepsilon_b$, $\varepsilon_{ab}$, and $\varepsilon_{ba}$ are the very small probability thresholds.
\begin{equation}
{R_i\left(P\right)=log}_2{\left(1+\frac{p_ig_{i,0}}{{\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{M}{p_jg_{j,0}}+\sigma}^2}\right)}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
\textbf{P1}:&\max \ {R_i\left(P\right)=log}_2{\left(1+\frac{p_ig_{i,0}}{{\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{M}{p_jg_{j,0}}+\sigma}^2}\right)}\\
s.t.&\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
&0\leq P_a\leq P_{a,max},\\
&\textrm{Pr} \{SINR_b\geq SINR_{b,min}\}\geq 1-\varepsilon_b,\\
&\xi_{ab} \geq 1-\varepsilon_{ab}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}\label{E6}
\begin{array}{rll}
&\max \limits_{P_J} \,\,U_J=-SINR_b-\mu_3P_J   \\
&s.t. \ 0\leq P_J\leq P_{J,max},
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E7}
\begin{array}{rll}
\textbf{P2}:&\max \limits_{P_b} \,\,U_C=\ln(SINR_a-SINR_{a,min})-\mu_2(P_a+P_b\alpha|h_{ab}|^2)\\
s.t.&\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
&0\leq P_b\leq P_{b,max},\\
&\textrm{Pr} \{SINR_a\geq SINR_{a,min}\}\geq 1-\varepsilon_a,\\
&\xi_{ba}\geq 1-\varepsilon_{ba}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
The shortcomings of these problems are that the channel uncertainty is not considered in the objective functions. I will consider it with the help of the characteristic of radar signal.
Moreover, the transformations of the covert communication constraints need to have a detailed derivation.
Through problem (P1), we can obtain an equality relation between $P_R$ and $P_J$ if the convex optimization theory can be applied to.

\subsection {Preliminaries}
As a novel parametrization of radar
performance, radar estimation rate (radar mutual information) has been mentioned in many works \cite{ARChiriyath}-\cite{AAhmed}.  The estimation rate is a metric analogous to the communications rate and provides
a measure of the information about a target (range, cross-section, shape, roughness or moisture level) that is gained from radar illumination in radar tracking estimation scenarios.
 In general, the target has some entropy or information
about itself that is not explicitly being communicated to the
radar system by the target. Radar illumination can be viewed
as the target unwillingly communicating this target entropy
or information to the radar receiver. Thus, this information rate is constructed by
considering the entropy of a random parameter being estimated
and the entropy of the estimation uncertainty of that parameter, and the radar channel can be characterized as an uncooperative communications channel \cite{ARChiriyath}.

Generally, waveform optimization is necessary for detection and target information extraction. Especially, the radar waveform is designed so as to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the target parameter of interest and the measurements obtained from the receiver \cite{ARChiriyath2}.

To improve the spectrum utilization efficiency and achieve the low cost of hardware, signal-sharing is the most popular approach used in joint radar and
communication (JRC) systems. There are two commonly used dual function signals, i.e,  Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) signal and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal \cite{NCLuong}.
It is noted that FMCW is a type of linear
frequency modulation (LFM) or chirp modulation in which the frequency increases or decreases with a so-called chirp rate \cite{CHW}. As for the radar function, it has
also been been pointed out in another study \cite{GFranken} that OFDM coded radar signals are comparable with LFM signals and furthermore, experiences no range-Doppler coupling \cite{YLSit}. Besides, the OFDM has several other advantages such as robustness against multipath fading, easy synchronization and equalization, and high flexibility \cite{NCLuong}. These advantages enable the OFDM to be effectively used for the target detection of the radar function.

 Given that these advantages of OFDM signal and the radar estimation rate which is  analogous to the communications data rate, many OFDM-based JRC systems \cite{KWHuang}-\cite{AAhmed} are considered to perform waveform design by maximizing the MI between target impulse response and the received signal.

In \cite{ARChiriyath2}, the involved JRC system does not explicitly state the type of signal. The JRC system consists of an active, mono-static, pulsed radar and a single-user communications system. The authors consider the
 JRC receiver to be a radar transmitter/receiver that can act as a communications receiver. The joint receiver can simultaneously estimate the radar target parameters from the radar return and decode a received communications signal.
In this scenario, the JRC system acts as a dual functional receiver, and the sources of the radar return signal and the communication signal are separated (from target and communication user, respectively). However, \cite{ARChiriyath2} only derives achievable bounds on performance for a receiver that observes communications and radar return in the same frequency allocation, the corresponding optimization problem is omitted. To integrate covert communications into this JRC system, we can introduce a jammer here to prevent the effective detection from the warden.

Besides, OFDM signal-based related works \cite{KWHuang}-\cite{MBicaK} proposed different Mutual Information based criteria for radar waveform optimization and  formulated the corresponding waveform optimization problems. However, these works consider the coexistence of radar and communication systems in the same spectrum, instead of dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) system. Moreover, the OFDM signal is early processed to facilitate the MI-based waveform design problem. There is a need to learn the corresponding knowledge of signal processing. After that, the optimization problem which maximizes the MI with interference constraints can be easily obtained.

In \cite{AAhmed}, a dual-purpose
OFDM transmitter is exploited which optimizes the transmit
power of different sub-carriers to fulfill the radar objectives.
These OFDM sub-carriers used by the radar are also allocated to different communication receivers to achieve the communications objectives (like D2D communication networks). The MI between the frequency-dependent target response and the transmit waveform is used as the optimization objective for radar performance.
The communication performance is optimized by allocating the
radar sub-carriers to different communication users by using MI
maximization as the criterion. The resulting optimization problem maximizing the MI for radar can be simplified a standard convex optimization. This work provides the most popular system framework.
\subsection {Vehicle Computation Task}
 We consider that each vehicle $u\in U$ has one computation task at a time. denoted as Tu , that is atomic and cannot be divided into subtasks. Each computation task Tu is characterized by a tuple of two parameters.I plan to have the detailed formula derivation for these works \cite{KWHuang}-\cite{AAhmed}, and formulate a reasonable system model .






The channels of RFE-PR, RFE-Tag, RFE-AR, Jammer-PR, Jammer-Tag, Jammer-AR, Tag-PR and Tag-AR are denoted by $g_{sw}$, $g_{st}$, $g_{sr}$, $g_{jw}$, $g_{jt}$, $g_{jr}$, $h_{tw}$ and $h_{tr}$, respectively.  Since the links of Tag-PR and Tag-AR operate over short distances,  $h_{tw}$ and $h_{tr}$ are assumed to meet the following channel model:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
h_{ij}=\hat{h}_{ij}+\tilde{h}_{ij}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ij$$\in$$\{tw, tr\}$. $\hat{h}_{ij}$ and $\tilde{h}_{ij}$ denote the estimated part and the deviation. They are zero-mean, independent, CSCG random variables. Their variances satisfy $\mathbb{E}[|\hat{h}_{ij}|^2] =K_{ij}\beta$ and
$\mathbb{E}[|\tilde{h}_{ij}|^2]=K_{ij}(1-\beta)$ to ensure the total power of $h_{ij}$ is $K_{ij}$.


The remaining long-distance links are assumed to follow Rayleigh fading and the corresponding average channel gains denote $\varphi_{kl}$, where $kl$$\in$$ \{sw,st,sr,jw,jt,jr\}$. (Could I assume that all $\varphi_{kl}$ is approximately equal since these long distances can be regarded as nearly equal in length?)


In this model, the backscatter signal reflected by tag is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E9}
\mathbf{x}(i)= \left(\sqrt{\alpha P}g_{st}\mathbf{e}(i)+\sqrt{\alpha J}g_{jt}\mathbf{j}(i)\right)\mathbf{s}(i),
\end{eqnarray}
where $i$$=$$1,2,\ldots, n$ is the index of each channel use, $\alpha$ is Tag's reflection coefficients for the signals from RF emitter and jammer. $P$ and $J$ are the transmit powers of RF emitter and jammer, respectively. The $i$-th elements of vector $\mathbf{e}$ and $\mathbf{j}$, $\mathbf{e}(i)$ and $\mathbf{j}(i)$, denote the signals emitted at RF emitter and jammer for the $i$-th channel use, respectively,  while $\mathbf{s}(i)$ is the signal modulated at Tag. Note that $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{e}(i)\mathbf{e}^{*}(i)]$$=$$1$, $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{j}(i)\mathbf{j}^{*}(i)]$$=$$1$ and $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{s}(i)\mathbf{s}^{*}(i)]$$=$$1$.(Could I here assume that the jammer signal is completely absorbed by Tag so that there are less energy to be detected and then ensure a good covert communication? However, the fact is that the reflection coefficients always be the same when there are several signals to be scattered at the same time.)

 The received signal at AmBC receiver is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E10}
\mathbf{y}_r(i)\!=\! h_{tr}\mathbf{x}(i)\!+\!\left(\sqrt{\phi P}g_{sr}\mathbf{e}(i)\!+\!\sqrt{\phi J}g_{jr}\mathbf{j}(i)\right)\!+\!\mathbf{n}_r (i),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{n}_r (i)$ is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at
AmBC receiver with zero mean and the variance of $\sigma_r^2$,  $\phi\in[0,1]$ is the interference cancellation coefficient and $\phi$$=$$0$ means
the perfect interference cancellation.

 The composite received signal at PR of
observation vector $\mathbf{y}_r$ for the $i$-th channel use is given by

\begin{equation}\label{E11}
\mathbf{y}_w(i)\!=\!
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\!\sqrt{P}g_{sw}\mathbf{e}(i)\!+\!\sqrt{J}g_{jw}\mathbf{j}(i)\!+\!\mathbf{n}_w (i), &\!\mathcal{H}_0, \\
\!\sqrt{P}g_{sw}\mathbf{e}(i)\!+\!\sqrt{J}g_{jw}\mathbf{j}(i)\!+\!\mathbf{x}(i)h_{tw}\!+\!\mathbf{n}_w (i) ,&\!\mathcal{H}_1,
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}\label{E12}
\mathbf{y}_w(i)\!=\!\!
\left\{
\begin{array}{*{20}ll}
\!\!\!\sqrt{P}g_{sw}\mathbf{e}(i)\!\!+\!\!\sqrt{J}g_{jw}\mathbf{j}(i)\!\!+\!\!\sqrt{\alpha J}g_{jt}\mathbf{j}(i)h_{tw}\!\!+\!\!\mathbf{n}_w (i), &\!\!\!\mathcal{H}_0, \\
\!\!\!\sqrt{P}g_{sw}\mathbf{e}(i)\!\!+\!\!\sqrt{J}g_{jw}\mathbf{j}(i)\!\!+\!\!\mathbf{x}(i)h_{tw}\!\!+\!\!\mathbf{n}_w (i) ,&\!\!\!\mathcal{H}_1,
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
We consider equal prior probability of $\mathcal{H}_0$ and $\mathcal{H}_1$ here. Let  $P_{FA}$ and $P_{MD}$ denote the probabilities of
false alarm and missed detection, respectively. Hence, PR's total probability of detection error $\xi$ can be given by,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E11}
\xi=P_{FA}+P_{MD},
\end{eqnarray}
where $P_{FA}$$=$$\mathbf{Pr}\{D_1|\mathcal{H}_0\}$ and $P_{MD}$$=$$ \mathbf{Pr}\{D_0|\mathcal{H}_1\}$. Due to the binary hypothesis detection, $D_1$ and $D_0$ represent the binary decisions that infer whether Tag reflects or not, respectively.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
P_w \mathop{\gtrless}\limits_{D_0}^{D_1}\tau,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tau$ is the energy detection threshold of PR.

$P_w=\frac{1}{n}\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}|\mathbf{y}_w(i)|^2$.

Specifically, there are two cases.

a)
\begin{equation}\label{E12}
P_w\!=\!
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\!\!\!P|g_{sw}|^2\!+\!\!J|g_{jw}|^2\!+\!\sigma_w^2, &\!\!\!\mathcal{H}_0, \\
\!\!\!P|g_{sw}|^2\!+\!\!J|g_{jw}|^2\!+\!\alpha(P|g_{st}|^2\!+\! J|g_{jt}|^2)|h_{tw}|^2\!+\!\sigma_w^2,&\!\!\!\mathcal{H}_1,
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
or

b)
\begin{equation}\label{}
P_w\!=\!
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\!\!\!P|g_{sw}|^2\!+\!\!J|g_{jw}|^2\!+\!\alpha J|g_{jt}|^2|h_{tw}|^2\!+\!\sigma_w^2, &\!\!\!\mathcal{H}_0, \\
\!\!\!P|g_{sw}|^2\!+\!\!J|g_{jw}|^2\!+\!\alpha( P|g_{st}|^2\!+\! J|g_{jt}|^2)|h_{tw}|^2\!+\!\sigma_w^2,&\!\!\!\mathcal{H}_1,
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
where case a) illustrates the binary decisions that inferring  whether Tag reflects the mixed signals or not, while case b) shows the binary decisions that inferring  whether Tag transmits information based on the single RF signal.

Minimizing sum of error probabilities

For case a), the equivalent noise power forms at PR under $\mathcal{H}_0$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
\sigma_w^{\prime2}=\tilde{\sigma}_w^2+\sigma_w^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tilde{\sigma}_w^2$$=$$P|g_{sw}|^2+J|g_{jw}|^2$, which follows generalized chi-squared distribution with the corresponding probability density function (PDF) derived from \cite{DHamma}.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E18}
f(x;m,\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_m)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^m a_i\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_i}\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}\label{E19}
a_i=\frac{1}{\lambda_i\prod\nolimits_{j=1,j\neq i}^m(1-\lambda_j/\lambda_i)}.
\end{eqnarray}
Under $\mathcal{H}_0$ in case a), we have $m=2$, and
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
\left(\lambda_1,\lambda_2\right)=(\mu,\nu).
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu$$=$$P\varphi_{sw}$, $\nu$$=$$J\varphi_{jw}$.
It is noted that the transmit power of RF emitter $P$ is always higher than the transmit power jammer $J$ in the real scenes.
Hence, when $\tau>\sigma_w^2$, $P_{FA}(\tau)$ can be determined through
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
\begin{array}{lll}
P_{FA}(\tau)&= \mathbf{Pr}\{\sigma_w^{\prime2}>\tau-\sigma_w^2\}\\
&=\sum\limits_{i=1}^2a_i\lambda_i\exp\left(-\frac{\tau-\sigma_w^2}{\lambda_i}\right)\\
&=\frac{\mu\exp(-\frac{\tau-\sigma_w^2}{\mu})-\nu\exp(-\frac{\tau-\sigma_w^2}{\nu})}{\mu-\nu} .
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
Eventually, the false alarm probability can be formulated as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
P_{FA}(\tau)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1, \tau\leq\sigma_w^2\\
\frac{\mu\exp(-\frac{\tau-\sigma_w^2}{\mu})-\nu\exp(-\frac{\tau-\sigma_w^2}{\nu})}{\mu-\nu} ,\tau>\sigma_w^2
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}[hptb!]
\centering\small
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures//figurec.eps}
\caption{ Secondary user data transmission rate under different numbers.}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the missed detection probability is formulated as

\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
P_{MD}(\tau)=\mathbf{Pr}\{\tilde{\sigma}_w^2\!+\!\alpha( P|g_{st}|^2\!+\! J|g_{jt}|^2)|h_{tw}|^2\!+\!\sigma_w^2\leq\tau\}.
\end{eqnarray}
Let $\theta$$\triangleq$$\tilde{\sigma}_w^2\!+\!\alpha( P|g_{st}|^2\!+\! J|g_{jt}|^2)K\!$, $K$$=$$|h_{tw}|^2$.
Under $\mathcal{H}_1$ in case a), we have $m=4$, and
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
\left(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3,\lambda_4\right)=(\mu,\nu,\alpha K\omega,\alpha K\pi).
\end{eqnarray}
where $\omega$$=$$P\varphi_{st}$, $\pi$$=$$J\varphi_{jt}$.
Based on  \eqref{E18} and \eqref{E19}, $P_{MD}(\tau)$ is reformulated as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
P_{MD}(\tau)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0, \tau\leq\sigma_w^2\\
\sum\limits_{i=1}^4\left[a_i\lambda_i-a_i\lambda_i\exp\left(-\frac{\tau-\sigma_w^2}{\lambda_i}\right)\right],\tau>\sigma_w^2
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}
where $a_1$$=$$\frac{P/\varphi_{sw}}{(P-J)(1-\alpha K)(P-\alpha KJ)}$, $a_2$$=$$\frac{J/\varphi_{jw}}{(J-P)(J-\alpha KP)(1-\alpha K)}$,\\
$a_3$$=$$\frac{P/\varphi_{st}}{(1-\frac{1}{\alpha K})(\alpha KP-J)(P-J)}$, and
$a_4$$=$$\frac{J/\varphi_{jt}}{(\alpha KJ-P)(1-\frac{1}{\alpha K})(J-P)}$, if $\varphi_{sw}$$\approx$$\varphi_{jw}$$\approx$$\varphi_{st}$$\approx$$\varphi_{jt}$. (Based on these, the monotonicity of $P_{MD}(\tau)$ is hard to determined when $m$$=$$4$. Most of the existing papers only consider the case of $m$$=$$2$. )

Through my calculation, I find that $\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^4a_i\lambda_i=1$, $a_1>0$, $a_2>0$, $a_3<0$, and $a_4<0$ when $\alpha KP>J$(i.e., the effective backscatter transmission from RF emitter to AmBC receiver is stronger than the direct link from jammer).


To capture the optimal detection threshold at the minimum total error probabilities, we need to solve the problem as follows
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
\min\limits_\tau\xi
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection {Next task}
 If there are no better solution, I will try the another method based on the existing system model. Here, the channel uncertainty can be dismissed and the uncertain power obeying the distribution in (18) and (19) can be considered, since there are exactly two power variables (i.e., the power of RF emitter and the power of jammer) .
