{\Large \underline{Response to Reviewer 1}}

We would like to thank the reviewer for spending his/her time to assess the paper, and make very constructive and detailed informative comments provided in the review.
Our responses are given as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
%R1Q1
\item\textbf{Question}: The authors should consider some benchmark schemes for comparison (performance, convergence, complexity).

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions! In this paper, we have compared with different benchmark schemes, including fractional transmission power allocation (FTPA) scheme and traditional OMA scheme. These schemes are widely used in comparison with NOMA schemes, such as

\footnotesize
Y. Saito, Y. Kishiyama, A. Benjebbour, T. Nakamura, A. Li, and K. Higuchi, ``Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for cellular future radio access,¡± \emph{in Proc. IEEE 77th Veh. Tech. Conf. (VTC Spring)}, Jun. 2013, pp. 1-5.

Y. Fu, Y. Chen and C. W. Sung, ``Distributed Power Control for the Downlink of Multi-Cell NOMA Systems," \emph{IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications}, vol. 16, no. 9, pp. 6207-6220, Sept. 2017.

B. Xu, Y. Chen, J. R. Carri¨®n and T. Zhang, ``Resource Allocation in Energy-Cooperation Enabled Two-Tier NOMA HetNets Toward Green 5G," \emph{IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications}, vol. 35, no. 12, pp. 2758-2770, Dec. 2017.

 \normalsize
 The rule of FTPA is that the transmit power is allocated based on the UEs' channel conditions, i.e., the weaker downlink channels will own more transmit power. To execute the FTPA in NOMA, we need to distribute the power according to the decoding order of different users in the same base station. Therefore, the transmission power allocated by user $i$ in base station $n$ is expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{50}
p_{i,n}=p_{n}\frac{(\frac{g_{i,n}}{I_{i,n^{'}}+\sigma^{2}})^{-a}}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{K_{n}}(\frac{g_{j,n}}{I_{j,n^{'}}+\sigma^{2}})^{-a}},
\end{eqnarray}
where $a$ denotes the decay factor with the range, $0<a<1$. When $a = 0$, the base station allocates the same amount of power to the associated users, and the quality of service of edge users cannot be guaranteed. However, the total energy efficiency of the system may increase, since more power is allocated to the users with better channels and higher transmission rates are achieved. When $a$ increases, the base station allocates more power to users with lower SINR. Hence, users with poor channel conditions have better QoS, and the fairness of the whole system can be improved.

In the simulation part of this paper, we have a detailed comparison with the FTPA scheme with $a = 0$, $a = 0.7$, respectively, and the OMA scheme. Figure \ref{4} shows that the energy efficiencies between the proposed algorithm and FTPA algorithm are different when different errors are considered. Figure \ref{6} shows the relationship between the total energy efficiency of the system and the number of users when different schemes are implemented. In the original manuscript, Figure 8 and Figure 9 also show the comparison results, and it is validated the proposed scheme is superior to other schemes. More details can be found in the revision.

        \caption{Energy efficiency versus the number of UEs for different power control algorithms.}
        \vspace*{2mm}
        \label{6}
\end{figure}

In addition, we have added the complexity contrast in the revision. In the user association algorithm, we propose a distributed user association algorithm which does not require any centralized coordination. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(MN)$ for each iteration, which is much lower than the brute force algorithm $O(M^{N})$, where $N$ is the total number of base stations, $M$ is the total number of users in the topology.


\item\textbf{Question}: The algorithm complexity needs to be discussed.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's comments!
We have added the complexity analysis of user association algorithm and power control algorithm in the revision. And the revised part is marked {in red}, the contents are as follows:

`` The centralized user association is intuitive, and requires a central controller, which has the global CSI and determines which user is connected to BS in this network. In this paper, the distributed user association algorithm does not require any centralized coordination. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(MN)$ for each iteration, which is much lower than the brute force algorithm $O(N^{M})$, where $N$ is the total number of base stations, $M$ is the total number of users in the topology.''


\item\textbf{Question}: The figures must be better presented: group curves, use dots after figure caption, etc.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions! The pointed issues have been modified in the revision. For instance, to make the picture clear, in iterative Figure 1, we used different colors to distinguish users under different base stations, and added a dot after the figure caption.

        \caption{The iteration of power.}
        \vspace*{2mm}
        \label{2}
\end{figure}




\item\textbf{Question}: The authors should consider the very relevant and new work regarding user association resource allocation in NOMA-based systems, e.g., Joint power control and user association for NOMA-based full-duplex systems, IEEE TComm, 2019. Additionally, some good, relevant and new surveys in the area of resource allocation should be considered, e.g., Resource allocation for downlink NOMA systems: Key techniques and open issues, IEEE WC 2018.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions! Some new relevant literature including the recommended papers have been added and reviewed in the revision.

\normalsize
In [6], the authors consider an FD-NOMA multiuser MISO (MU-MISO) system. On the premise of ensuring the user-specific quality-of-service and total transmit power, the problem of joint optimization of user association (UA) and power control to maximize the overall spectral efficiency (SE) is proposed. In addition, a new transformation method is proposed to solve the problem of mixed-integer non-convex programming. In [7], the authors provide a detailed classification survey of user pairing and power allocation algorithm in the downlink NOMA network, and discusses the key role of resource allocation scheme in realizing the maximum benefit of NOMA network. Finally, joint optimization of UP and PA, RA for FD MC MIMO-NOMA, low-complexity RA, and  security-aware RA are analyzed, which provides ideas for the future research of NOMA network.

{\Large \underline{Response to Reviewer 2}}

We would like to thank the reviewer for the careful examining work and the time spent.

Our responses to the reviewer's comments are given as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
%R2Q1
\item\textbf{Question}: The authors have provided a detailed literature review regarding the communication characteristics of the non-orthogonal multiple access technique. However, the authors should discuss the users' service requirements within 5G networks supported by the NOMA technology, such real time and non-real time services, e.g., Vamvakas, P., et al. ``Optimization and resource management in NOMA wireless networks supporting real and non-real time service bundling." 2017 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC). IEEE, 2017, and the elastic and inelastic applications, Gutierrez-Estevez, David M., et al. ``The path towards resource elasticity for 5g network architecture." 2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops. IEEE, 2018. This additional discussion will cover both the communication characteristics (that already exist in the paper) and the users' characteristics that are missing.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's comments! The revelent discussions have been added and the mentioned references have been cited in the revision.

\normalsize
``In addition, many literatures have made a detailed study on the user characteristics of 5g network. In [21], the authors provide multiple services for each user in the uplink NOMA network, and the user's demand for real-time and non real-time services is constructed into two parts of the effectiveness function. Finally, a distributed algorithm based on game theory is proposed. In [22], in order to make more effective use of computing resources in 5G network and more flexible allocation of resources, the authors put forward the concept of resource elasticity. In addition, it also provides set of requirements and KPIs, and gives mechanisms for the exploitation of elasticity in three different dimensions, which provides the basis for the future virtualized and cloudified 5G.''

%R2Q2
\item\textbf{Question}: The authors introduce and solve a centralized optimization problem. However, it is not clear based on the provided analysis, where this problem is practically solved in a heterogeneous network. In the literature, there have been adopted several game-theoretic approaches to solve similar problems in a distributed manner, e.g., Tsiropoulou, E.E., et al. "Efficient uplink power control in multi-service two-tier femtocell networks via a game theoretic approach." 2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks. IEEE, 2013, Al-Zahrani, Ali Y., and F. Richard Yu. "An energy-efficient resource allocation and interference management scheme in green heterogeneous networks using game theory." IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 65.7 (2015): 5384-5396. The authors should discuss those alternative approaches and better justify their concept of proposing a centralized approach. Also, they should clarify in which part of the network the proposed resource allocation problem is solved.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's comments!
The algorithm provided in this paper is also a distributed algorithm. In the revision, we have added the discussions about the centralized and distributed algorithms in the introduction, and also added the explanations about the algorithm execution in the text. Some modifications are as follow.

``In reference [35], the authors propose a global optimization algorithm in wireless networks, which is suitable for small-scale topology only. The centralized algorithms are also developed in references [36] and [37], however they may not be applicable in 5G network, because it is difficult to exchange the global network information in such settings, including the random network deployment and the limited backhaul capacity available for control and signaling. The distributed algorithm has great advantage in the research of wireless heterogeneous network. In [36], the authors study the problem of supporting real-time and non real-time distributed power distribution. A generic utility-based framework is established, and game theory is adopted to solve the optimization problem. In [37], the authors propose a distributed solution for energy-saving resource allocation and inter cell interference management in wireless networks, which realizes the flexible dynamic partitioning of resources between macro cells and small cells."

As for how to solve the resource allocation problem in the network, we will explain it in combination with the next question.

\normalsize
%R2Q3
\item\textbf{Question}: Following the previous comment, the authors should discuss what is the communication and signaling overhead that is imposed to the users in order the proposed resource management problem to be solved. A simple example is that each user is not informed of the interference in the surrounding environment, or the order that is signal is demodulated at the receiver based on the successive interference cancelation technique, in order to adapt accordingly its transmission power. Those are some practical questions that the authors should better clarify, discuss and explain in the manuscript.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions!

In order to better explain how to solve the problem of resource allocation. We show the execution process of the algorithm 1 more clearly.

\end{algorithmic}
\label{algorithm_1}

Each step of power control algorithm can be executed by an individual base station $n$ with:

1. Interference terms $I_{i,n}$ locally measured and fed back by its own user $i, i\in n$ .

2. Scaled inverse interference terms $Y_{w}(\mathbf{p}^{t_{l}})$ broadcast by other base station $w \neq n$ , where we define:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{45}
Y_{w}=\sum\limits_{r=1}^{K_{w}}[\alpha_{r,w}\frac{1}{I_{r,w}}g_{(i,n),(r,w)}+\lambda_{r,w}\frac{g_{(i,n),(r,w)}}{-\ln(1-\varepsilon)g_{r,w}}],
\end{eqnarray}

3. Channel gains $g_{(i,n),(r,w)}$ measured and fed back by user $i, i\in n$.

\end{eqnarray}





%R2Q4
\item\textbf{Question}: In Section IV, in Equation (20), please delete the steps 3 and 4 in the analysis, as they are basic math knowledge. There is no need to be included in a journal paper. This is a friendly advice.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions!
We made corrections in the revision.



%R2Q5
\item\textbf{Question}: In Section V, the authors should provide the complexity analysis of the introduced algorithms. Following this addition, the authors should provide some indicative numerical results of the actual execution time of the introduced framework, as currently figures 2 and 3 are presenting the iterations. However, the iterations are not a realistic metric of the actual execution time. The authors can easily measure the actual execution time through Matlab or Python based on their adopted simulation environment.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions!
We add the complexity analysis of user association algorithm and power control algorithm in the revision. And the revised part is marked {in red}, the contents are as follows:

`` The centralized user association is intuitive, and requires a central controller, which has the global CSI and determines which user is connected to a BS in this network. In this paper, we propose a distributed user association algorithm which does not require any centralized coordination. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(MN)$ for each iteration, which is much lower than the brute force algorithm $O(N^{M})$, where $N$ is the total number of base stations. $M$ is the total number of users in the topology. In addition, we have analyzed the complexity of the proposed distributed power control algorithm, In the inner loop $t_{l}$, the complexity of EACH iteration is $O(MM)$, $M$ is the total number of users in the topology,''

This paper uses MATLAB as a simulation platform. The program running time depends on simulation parameters, simulator and hardware. The running time of our distributed joint user association and power control algorithm is 0.384889s.




\item\textbf{Question}: Minor: Table I has a weird format that should be fixed.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's carefulness and sorry for our negligence!
We readjusted it in the revision.

\end{enumerate}
Finally, thanks the reviewer again for the comments provided, and the time and efforts spent in the review. We hope that the above modifications have answered the reviewer's concerns.

{\Large \underline{Response to Reviewer 3}}

We would like to thank the reviewer for the careful examining work and the time spent.

Our responses to the reviewer's comments are given as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
%R2Q1
\item\textbf{Question}: According to the abstract, ¡°The joint user association and power control algorithm is presented to determine the optimal resource allocations.¡± Since the optimal solutions are obtained, the authors need to judge/prove this in the main text.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's carefulness and sorry for our negligence!
Here we have the problem of expression. For the original problem (6), we first decompose it into user association problem and power control problem. When dealing with the user association problem, we first relax the constraint to make the optimization problem become a continuous convex problem, then transform the constrained convex problem into an unconstrained convex problem by Lagrangian method, and then obtain the optimal solution of unconstrained convex problem by partial derivation. When we deal with the power allocation problem, because the problem is non convex, we use the logarithmic approximation method to transform the non convex problem into a convex problem, and then solve the convex problem. In literature ``\emph{ G. Ye, H. Zhang, H. Liu, J. Cheng and V. C. M. Leung, "Energy Efficient Joint User Association and Power Allocation in a Two-Tier Heterogeneous Network," 2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), Washington, DC, 2016, pp. 1-5.}", ``\emph{ D. T. Ngo, S. Khakurel and T.

For the original problem (6), which is a mixed integer non-convex programming problem, it usually needs exponential complexity to find its global optimal solution, this is often unrealistic. Mentioned in literature ``\emph{ H. H. Kha, H. D. Tuan, and H. H. Nguyen, ¡°Fast global optimal power

Julian, ¡°Power control by geometric programming,¡± IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 2640¨C2651, July 2007.}" and ``\emph{J. Papandriopoulos and J. S. Evans, ¡°SCALE: a low-complexity distributed protocol for spectrum balancing in multiuser DSL networks,¡± IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 55, no. 8, pp. 3711¨C3724, Aug. 2009.}", `` the performance gap from the locally optimal found by the proposed logarithmic approximation method approach to the actual globally optimal is unknown. While one may believe that the method with a globally optimal power allocation would outperform that with any local power optimization, the proof of such is unavailable. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that the logarithmic approximation method approach often empirically achieves the globally optimal power allocation.''

In the revised version, we have revised the improper wording of the simulation part. we changed ``The joint user association and power control algorithm is presented to determine the optimal resource allocations.'' to ``The joint user association and power control algorithm is presented, and provides a solution to the problem of mixed integer non-convex programming.'' to make the article more rigorous.

\item\textbf{Question}: In the introduction, NOMA can be used to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization. There are some related papers. For example, the optimal power control is derived in [R1] in a downlink single-cell network with individual QoS constraints. Considering the user fairness, the optimal resource allocation is derived in [R2] for visible light communication.
[R1] On the optimality of power allocation for NOMA downlinks with individual QoS constraints
[R2] Fair non-orthogonal multiple access for visible light communication downlinks

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions!
We quoted references [R1] and [R2] in the introduction, and the specific contents in the version are as follows:

In [R1], the authors studied the sum rate maximization problem in a downlink single-input single-output NOMA system, and find the global optimal solution. In [R2], the authors studied the problem of maximizing the total throughput of multiple users in the visible light communication (VLC) systems with NOMA, and guarantees the fairness of users. A low complexity optimal power control algorithm is proposed.

%R2Q3
\item\textbf{Question}: For constraint (C5), the SIC propagation error may needs to be mentioned for NOMA. Besides, problem (9) is a linear problem. The motivation of using dual method needs to be highlighted.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions!
Regarding the error of SIC propagation, we discussed it in Figure 4 and Figure 5 of the original text.

Fig. 4 shows that the energy efficiencies between the proposed algorithm and FTPA algorithm are different when different errors are considered. we compare the performance between the imperfect SIC. It can be found that the total energy efficiency of the system decreases when the SIC error increases.
\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{buwanquansic111.eps}
        \caption{Energy efficiency versus the error ratio for different power control algorithms.}
        \vspace*{2mm}
        \label{44}
\end{figure}

Fig. 5 shows the differences of energy efficiencies of each user when different SIC errors are considered using the proposed algorithm. When SIC error is $10^{-1.5}$, $10^{-2}$, $10^{-2.5}$ and perfect SIC respectively, the energy efficiency of each user will gradually decrease with the increase of SIC error. In the same base station, for example, users 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 select the MBS. Because the CINR value of user 1-1 is larger than that of user 1-2 and user 1-3, with the increase of SIC error, the energy efficiency of user 1-1 decreases more greatly. Therefore, the SIC error will have a greater impact on the final decoded user.

        \vspace*{2mm}
        \label{55}
\end{figure}

The dual function is given by $g(\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\mu}) = \max \limits_{\mathbf{x}} L(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\mu})$,and the dual problem of (9) is expressed as $\min \limits_{\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\mu}}g(\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\mu})$, In this case, we only need to give the dual variables $\theta$ and $\mu$ to get the optimal solution of the maximal Lagrangian function $L(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\mu})$ about $\mathbf{x}$. The dual method is also explained in reference [R2] provided by the reviewer: ``Specifically, the dual method is implemented by iteratively solving the primal variables with fixed dual variables, and updating the dual variables with given optimization variables.''. In reference ``\emph{ G. Ye, H. Zhang, H. Liu, J. Cheng and V. C. M. Leung, "Energy Efficient Joint User Association and Power Allocation in a Two-Tier Heterogeneous Network," 2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), Washington, DC, 2016, pp. 1-5.}", the dual method is also used to solve the user association problem in wireless networks.





%R2Q4
\item\textbf{Question}: Distributed power control and user association algorithm is proposed. It is very good. For distributed algorithm, the author may need to mention the implementations such as in power control for multi-cell networks with non-orthogonal multiple access.

\textbf{Answer}: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions!
The centralized user association is intuitive, and requires a central controller, which has the global CSI. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm which does not require any centralized coordination. In order to better explain how to solve the problem of resource allocation. We show more clearly the execution process of the algorithm to explain the implementation of the distributed algorithm 3:
\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Distributed joint user association}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE {At user side}
\IF {$t=0$}
\STATE Each user measures its received inter-cell interference via pilot signal from all base stations, gets the CINR value, and then feeds back to the corresponding base station. After that, each user chooses to have the largest CINR value base station.
\ELSE
\STATE User $i$ receives the values of $h_{i,n}$ and $R_{i,n}$ from the base station.
\STATE User $i$ selects the service from the base station based on: $y^{*} = \mathop{ \arg \max}\limits_{\mathbf{x}} (h_{i,n})$.
\ENDIF
\STATE $t=t+1$.
\STATE Each user feedbacks the user association request to the chosen base station.
\end{algorithmic}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE {At base station side}
\IF {$t=0$}
\STATE Initialization: multiplier $\theta_{n}$.
\ELSE
\STATE Receives the updated user association matrix $\mathbf{x}$.
\STATE Update the multiplier $\theta_{n}$ based on (18).
\STATE  Each base station update $h_{i,n}$ and $R_{i,n}$ according to NOMA rule.
\ENDIF
\STATE $t=t+1$.
\STATE Each base station broadcasts the values of $h_{i,n}$ and $R_{i,n}$
\end{algorithmic}
\label{algorithm_3}
\end{algorithm}

In the power control problem, We combine algorithmic process to explain the implementation of distributed algorithm 4:

each step of power control algorithm can be executed by an individual base station $n$ with:

1. Interference terms $I_{i,n}$ locally measured and fed back by its own user $i, i\in n$ .

2. Scaled inverse interference terms $Y_{w}(\mathbf{p}^{t_{l}})$ broadcast by other base station $w \neq n$ , where we define:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{45}
Y_{w}=\sum\limits_{r=1}^{K_{w}}[\alpha_{r,w}\frac{1}{I_{r,w}}g_{(i,n),(r,w)}+\lambda_{r,w}\frac{g_{(i,n),(r,w)}}{-\ln(1-\varepsilon)g_{r,w}}],
\end{eqnarray}

3. Channel gains $g_{(i,n),(r,w)}$ measured and fed back by user $i, i\in n$.
